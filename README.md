This is a simple recipe webpage, consiting of several 
recipes to mouthwatering dishes.


It will employ the use of HTML elements like images, paragraph, heading, anchor
and several attributes like href, charset,lang, src, etc. to make the page more engaging

Keep in mind that there has no usage of CSS in this project and the CSS will be employed later on in this project to enhance the look and feel of the overall website.


For now it's just a showcase of basic html tags know-how.
