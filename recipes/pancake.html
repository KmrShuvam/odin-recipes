    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>German apple pancake is also known as a <strong>Dutch baby. </strong>It is a terrific baked pancake recipe for those special occasions. If you are strapped for time, you can start it the evening before and pretty much pop it in the oven. 
        Delicious topped with powdered sugar, 
        maple syrup, or a dollop of yogurt.</p>
